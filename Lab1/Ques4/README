The TCP Client Server program will help a client request for a decremented value of an integer value. The port number is fetched from the command line argument separated by a blank space during running the compiled executable.
Follow the below steps to run the TCP client and server program.
1: Use command -> cd <Directory name> ;to go to the directory where the file is stored.
2: Run the makefile using command -> make.
3: Run the command -> ./server.o portnumber to run the server side.
4: Run the command -> ./client.o portnumber to run the client side on a separate terminal.
5: Enter the numeric that is to be decremented on the client window.
6: The Server will be sending the decremented numeric as the output of the question. 

Test Case:
After compiling the code, run the server.o and client.o executables on different terminal windows.
Terminal window 1
./server.o 4547
Terminal Window 2
./client.o 4547

Scenario:	Client send an integer and the server 
		decrements the value by 1 and sends it 
		back to the client. 

Actual output:	Please enter a numeric digit: 45
		Value received from the server after decrementing is 44

Expected output: Please enter a numeric digit: 45
		 Value received from the server after decrementing is 44

Result:	Pass

*The program takes port number as a command line argument (2nd argument) separated by a blank space.
